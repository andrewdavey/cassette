FOSS License Exception
===================================================================

What is the FOSS License Exception?

This Free and Open Source Software ("FOSS") License Exception allows 
developers of FOSS applications to include Cassette with their FOSS 
applications. Cassette is typically licensed pursuant to version 3
of the General Public License ("GPL"), but this exception permits 
distribution of Cassette with a developer's FOSS applications licensed 
under the terms of another FOSS license listed below, even though such 
other FOSS license may be incompatible with the GPL.

The following terms and conditions describe the circumstances under which 
this FOSS License Exception applies.

FOSS License Exception Terms and Conditions

Definitions:

	* "Derivative Work" means a derivative work, as defined under applicable 
	   copyright law, formed entirely from the Program and one or more FOSS Applications.
	* "FOSS Application" means a free and open source software application distributed 
	   subject to a license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) board. A list of 
	   applicable licenses appears at: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category.
	* "FOSS Notice" means a notice placed by Andrew Davey or the Cassette author 
	   in a copy of the Cassette library stating that such copy of the Cassette library 
	   may be distributed under Andrew Davey's or Cassette's FOSS License Exception.
	* "Independent Work" means portions of the Derivative Work that are not derived 
	   from the Program and can reasonably be considered independent and separate works.
	* "Program" means a copy of Andrew Davey's Cassette library that contains a FOSS 
	   Notice.

A FOSS application developer ("you" or "your") may distribute a Derivative Work provided 
that you and the Derivative Work meet all of the following conditions:

	* You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and all portions (including 
	  modifications) of the Program included in the Derivative Work (provided that this 
	  condition does not apply to Independent Works);
	* The Derivative Work does not include any work licensed under the GPL other than 
	  the Program;
	* You distribute Independent Works subject to a license approved by the OSI which is 
	  listed in http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category;
	* You distribute Independent Works in object code or executable form with the complete 
	  corresponding machine-readable source code on the same medium and under the same 
	  FOSS license applying to the object code or executable forms;
	* All works that are aggregated with the Program or the Derivative Work on a medium or 
	  volume of storage are not derivative works of the Program, Derivative Work or FOSS 
	  Application, and must reasonably be considered independent and separate works.

Andrew Davey reserves all rights not expressly granted in these terms and conditions. 
If all of the above conditions are not met, then this FOSS License Exception does not 
apply to you or your Derivative Work.
