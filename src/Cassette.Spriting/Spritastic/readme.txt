This spriting code is copied from
https://github.com/andrewdavey/RequestReduce/tree/spriting
which is originally forked from
https://github.com/mwrock/RequestReduce

Eventually the Spritastic code may be form a standalone library,
which Cassette.Spriting could use. For now though, while the code is still
being developed, an internalised copy of the source is used.
